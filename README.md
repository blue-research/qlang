# Quantum language models

## Goals
1. Create a systematic way to study the effects of sentence rewriters and ansatz algorithms.
2. Interpret and explain the behavior of different combinations of rewriters and ansatz.
3. Design a new ansatz algorithm (e.g., sentence length agnostic?)

### Tasks
1. Run experiments using a different number of layers.
2. Run experiments on rc dataset
3. Plot ansatz circuit
4. Explain results (effects of normalization, rewriting it again)
5. Discuss increasing the length of sentences (more parameters?)
