# qnlg - Quantum Natural Language Generation

## Tasks
1. Improve classification model's accuracy
    - Change dataset from mc_train -> stanfordnlp/sst2 (larger dataset)
    - Test different ansatz and hyperparameters
    - Test different classification model and hyperparameters
2. Improve qnlg algorithm's accuracy (draft)
    - Superposition for Sentence Generation: Create a superposition of multiple sentence states to evaluate them simultaneously, leveraging quantum parallelism. This requires a quantum circuit that can represent and manipulate sentences in superposition.
    - Entanglement for Contextual Understanding: Design parts of the quantum circuit to entangle words or phrases, potentially capturing more nuanced, contextual relationships between them. This could lead to more accurate scoring and measure similarity of sentences.
