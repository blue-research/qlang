# Quantum language models

## Goals
1. Create a systematic way to study the effects of sentence rewriters and ansatz algorithms.
2. Interpret and explain the behavior of different combinations of rewriters and ansatz.
3. Design a new ansatz algorithm (e.g., sentence length agnostic?)

### Tasks
1. Run experiments on both mc and rc dataset
2. Plot both loss and accuracy
3. Use HPC parallelism to speed things up
4. Interpret experiment results
