# Comparative Study of the AnsÃ¤tze in Quantum Language Models

This repository contains the implementation and experimental framework used in the study _"Comparative study of the ansÃ¤tze in quantum language models"_. The research explores how different ansÃ¤tze and hyperparameters influence Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) models for text classification tasks. It evaluates both circuit-based and tensor-based approaches using the Lambeq library and quantum simulation backends.

## ðŸ”¬ Features

- Full QNLP pipeline with:
  - Sentence-to-diagram conversion via pregroup grammar
  - Optional rewriting of diagrams (`re`, `re_norm`, `re_norm_cur`, `re_norm_cur_norm`)
  - Conversion into quantum circuits or tensor networks
- Multiple ansÃ¤tze supported:
  - **Circuit-based**:
    - IQPAnsatz
    - StronglyEntanglingAnsatz
    - Sim14Ansatz
    - Sim15Ansatz
  - **Tensor-based**:
    - MPSAnsatz
    - SpiderAnsatz
    - TensorAnsatz
- Hyperparameter exploration:
  - Number of layers
  - Single-qubit rotations
- Results include:
  - Training/validation loss and accuracy
  - Overfitting and convergence trends
  - Test performance comparison
 
## ðŸ§ª Running the Experiments

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Training the models and hyperparameter tuning & evaluation

```
python run_experiments_all.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary

Best circuit-based performance: Sim14Ansatz + re_norm_cur_norm (100% validation accuracy)

Best tensor-based performance: SpiderAnsatz + re (100% validation accuracy, lowest loss)

Diagram simplification via rewriting significantly improves both convergence and generalization for grammatically simple sentences.

Careful hyperparameter tuning is key to optimal model design for the average sentence complexity of the dataset.
